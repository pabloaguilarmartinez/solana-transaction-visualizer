# Solana Transaction Visualizer

## Challenge 02 from Doge Academy.
Building a web application that allows a user to input a Solana transaction ID and display the details of that 
transaction in a user-friendly way. You will need to use the Solana Web3.js API to fetch transaction data. The app will 
be a single-page application built with React.

### Requirements
- The application should be built using React.
- It should include a form where users can input a Solana transaction ID.
- Use the Solana Web3.js API to fetch and parse transaction details.
- Display the transaction details on the web page in a clear and intuitive format.
- Display an error message if the transaction ID is not valid or does not exist.
- The design should be clean and responsive (mobile-friendly).

## Stack
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS

## Considerations
The web is up and running on: [https://pam-solana-transaction-visualizer.vercel.app/](https://pam-solana-transaction-visualizer.vercel.app/).
We are using the Solana devnet, so transactions from mainnet and testnet will not be found.
